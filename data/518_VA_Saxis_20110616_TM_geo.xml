      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>This US Topo map product is compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within 0.02 inch of the true position. In this product, the projection line, grids, and orthoimage are believed to meet NMAS. Positional accuracy of the other data layers is less controllable because of diversity of data sources, and may not meet NMAS.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>The accuracy of the National Elevation Dataset (NED) is inherited from the source digital elevation models (DEMs). The overall absolute vertical accuracy expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) is 2.44 meters. The measured vertical RMSE was converted to equivalent NMAS and NSSDA expressions. The accuracy is expressed in terms of the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS), which use a 90 percent confidence interval, and in terms of the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA), which uses a 95 percent confidence interval. </vertaccr>

            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The FSTopo database was originally populated with Cartographic Feature File (CFF) data. CFF data were derived from the standard Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) or Single Edition Series (SES) map as part of the Forest Service National Geographic Information System Plan. PBS and SES maps were developed from the U.S. Geological Survey 1:24,000-scale, 7.5-minute topographic map series, with enhancements and regular revisions to satisfy Forest Service needs. Except in Alaska, where 1:63,360-scale maps are used, the original USGS 1:24,000-scale source maps were constructed to meet National Map Accuracy Standards, which require that 90 percent of all well-defined features shown on the map are within .02 inches of their true location. CFF data were collected using methods and the best technologies available to ensure that digitized elements were captured within .003 inches of corresponding elements shown on source maps. The USDA Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC) uses the same data collection accuracy standard for additions and revisions to the data. Only maps in USDA Forest Service areas will contain USDA Forest roads.</othercit>

            <othercit>The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. The high-resolution NHD was originally created using 1:24,000-scale data. State and Local Stewards are improving the data by incorporating local updates based on more current and more accurate source data. Water features in the real world are relatively dynamic and the differences at the time of data collection mean that water features may not register exactly to other layers. The hydrographic feature names contained in and displayed by the NHD are extracted and validated from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).</othercit>

            <title>U.S.-Mexico National Boundary</title>
            <othercit>The international boundary between Mexico and the United States, defined as a joint venture between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía of Mexico (INEGI), resulted in an unofficial United States-Mexico boundary dataset that was further enhanced by the U.S. Geological Survey's Border Environmental Health Initiative (BEHI). With the data frame scale set to 1:5,000 in ArcMap, the center of the Rio Grande/Río Bravo was digitized using the NAIP 2004 Imagery. In areas with dense stands of salt cedar (bounding box = UL -104.714 30.038, UR -104.664 30.037, LR -104.666 29.933, LL -104.717 29.934; NAD83), the center of the channel was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to easily determine. To determine the location of the boundary, the GIS analyst compared the location of the line in the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class with the NAIP 2004 Imagery and adjusted the boundary to the image, thus, the delineation of the international boundary is less certain in these areas. The remaining part of the border was extracted from the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class and appended to the line feature class created along the Rio Grande/Río Bravo. The U.S. Geological Survey reviewed the original USDA data against 2007 NAIP imagery and further edited 9 line segments in the Rio Grande areas to conform to National Map Accuracy Standards.</othercit>

The following area types are included: National Forest, Experimental Area, Experimental Forest, Experimental Range, Land Utilization Project, National Grassland, Purchase Unit, and Special Management Area. The nationwide Proclaimed Forest dataset was created by the USDA Forest Service, Washington Office Automated Lands Program (ALP) staff from collected source data created by the Regional Offices. Only maps in USDA Forest Service areas will contain USDA Forest boundaries.</othercit>

            <othercit>This contour featureclass was generated from the 1/3 arc-second version of the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The intended viewing scale for these features is 1:24,000. The contours are derived from a filtered elevation raster to achieve smoother arcs. The NED data were modified by the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) flow lines and water bodies to facilitate improved integration between the hypsography and hydrography on USGS map products. These contours were generated primarily for use as a layer in GeoPDFs created in the US Topo digital mapping program. The raster data source of contours is the National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1/3 arc-second layer. The 1/3 arc-second NED contains resampled data from the 1/9 arc-second layer of NED. Secondary datasets include the high resolution flow lines, water bodies, and areas from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The NHD layers are used in hydro-enforcement of the DEM prior to contour generation. The goals of the hydro-enforcement are to prevent contour lines from extending over the surface of water bodies and to align the contour reentrants with the NHD single-line streams. The NED raster cells are converted to points. Those points, along with the NHD flow lines are input into an interpolation tool to create a new surface. The NHD water bodies and areas are preprocessed to attach the minimum and maximum elevation to each polygon. From these precalculated values, an appropriate value is calculated by which to raise the elevation cells under the NHD polygons. The NHD polygons are then converted into rasters, which in turn will be used to generate a mosaic that includes the new raster surface. The mosaic is filtered to provide smoother contour lines. Contours are generated and depression and index contours are identified. There is no guarantee or warranty concerning the accuracy of the data. Users should be aware that temporal changes may have occurred since these data were collected and generated and that some parts of these data may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Hydro-enforcement and generalization can also significantly alter the spatial characteristics of the contours. Users should not use these data for critical applications without a full awareness of its limitations.</othercit>
