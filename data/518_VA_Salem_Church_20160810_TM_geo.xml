    <logic>This product is a layered geospatial PDF file.</logic>
    <complete>Each layer of the geospatial PDF is extracted from the USGS national geospatial databases. These data are intended to be cartographically complete at the scales that the map is produced, 1:24,000 scale in the conterminous 48 states and Hawaii, 1:25,000 scale in Alaska, and 1:20,000 scale in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>This US Topo map product is compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within 0.02 inch of the true position. In this product, the projection line, grids, and orthoimage are believed to meet NMAS. Positional accuracy of the other data layers is less controllable because of diversity of data sources, and may not meet NMAS.</horizpar>
      </horizpa>
      <vertacc>
        <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy report: US Topo contours are derived from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED).  Accuracy of the NED is inherited from various sources of digital elevation models used to populate the NED.  These data sources vary in vertical accuracy depending on collection method, control accuracy and density, and local terrain relief.  The overall absolute vertical accuracy of the NED, as tested against HARN control elevations, is 4.78 meters at 95% confidence level (National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy).  US Topo contours are derived from the NED to generally meet National Map Accuracy Standards (90% of well-defined points in reasonably level terrain test within one-half contour interval of the true ground elevation); however, actual vertical accuracies of individual US Topo quadrangles may not meet that standard.  Quadrangles containing collar notes stating contours "May not meet National Map Accuracy Standards" are in areas where the source is known to be questionable for meeting NMAS for the stated contour interval.</vertaccr>

            <othercit>For the conterminous 48 states, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Hawaii - "Dataset source is Census Bureau MAF/TIGER database extracts in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent dataset, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The U.S. Geological Survey filters Census roads to remove short road segments which are less than 500 feet in length, are not named and are classified as local roads. Census roads are not mixed with other road data sources within a 7.5-minute US Topo quadrangle with the exception of U.S. Forest Service lands, where public domain data from the Forest Service are used. The USGS National Transportation Dataset functional road classification system is applied to the Census datasets.The original TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau. The horizontal spatial accuracy information present in the TIGER/Line shapefiles is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only and the data may not be suitable for high-precision measurement applications. Full metadata for TIGER/Line shapefiles is available from U.S. Census Bureau." For Alaska - "Roads gathered from various state and local sources, integrated by the Alaska Department of Transportation (ADOT) and provided to USGS for use in USGS map products. This specific road dataset is unpublished, but earlier versions are published on the ADOT web site."</othercit>

            <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The FSTopo database was originally populated with Cartographic Feature File (CFF) data. CFF data were derived from the standard Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) or Single Edition Series (SES) map as part of the Forest Service National Geographic Information System Plan. PBS and SES maps were developed from the U.S. Geological Survey 1:24,000-scale, 7.5-minute topographic map series, with enhancements and regular revisions to satisfy Forest Service needs. Except in Alaska, where 1:63,360-scale maps are used, the original USGS 1:24,000-scale source maps were constructed to meet National Map Accuracy Standards, which require that 90 percent of all well-defined features shown on the map are within .02 inches of their true location. CFF data were collected using methods and the best technologies available to ensure that digitized elements were captured within .003 inches of corresponding elements shown on source maps. The USDA Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC) uses the same data collection accuracy standard for additions and revisions to the data. Only maps in USDA Forest Service areas will contain USDA Forest roads.</othercit>

            <title>Recreational Trails</title>
            <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The first recreational trails were added to US Topo maps in 2013. The data for trails come from a variety of sources. Accuracy and currency is the responsibility of the data owner; USGS evaluates the authoritativeness of the source but does not independently verify data accuracy. Trails are not complete, and will not be complete for the foreseeable future. Trails will be added as data become available from land management agencies and other authoritative sources.  All recreational trails information presented on US Topo maps is public domain, though the original source data is not necessarily public domain. This metadata section documents all data sources for all maps, not this specific map. Trails listed here are not guaranteed to be present on all relevant maps, due to schedule differences between data delivery and US Topo production schedules. Feature-level metadata is not provided in the US Topo product; there is no link between a line on the map and the source of that specific trail. Notes on data sources follow --------- For the 11 National Scenic Trails (NST): Ice Age National Scenic Trail: data provided by the volunteer organization Ice Age Trail Alliance, http://www.iceagetrail.org, in cooperation with National Park Service and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. -- Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail: unpublished data provided by US Forest Service -- Appalachian National Scenic Trail: data published by the Appalachian Trial Conservancy, http://appalachiantrail.org/about-the-trail/mapping-gis-data, in cooperation with National Park Service -- North Country National Scenic Trail: unpublished dataset provided by National Park Service -- Arizona National Scenic Trail: data from AZGEO Clearinghouse, https://azgeo.az.gov/azgeo/, in cooperation with U.S. Forest Service -- Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail: unpublished data provided by US Forest Service -- Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail: unpublished dataset provided by National Park Service -- Florida National Scenic Trail: data from US Forest Service, http://www.fs.usda.gov/main/fnst/maps-publications -- Selected National Parks may have trails provided by National Park Service---------- For other trail types and sources: US Fish and Wildlife Service lands: the USFWS Hiking Trails Inventory is administered by the US Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, and Pacific Western Technologies, LTD. The purpose of the dataset is to create a baseline inventory of all non-motorized trails on US Fish and Wildlife Service Stations.  -- US Forest Service lands in Colorado: trails within National Forests are from unpublished data provided by USFS. Other US Forest Service lands: limited trails data published at http://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/. USFS data are developed from sources of differing accuracy. US Topo does not portray access and travel management information indicating which trails are managed for or open to specific modes of travel (motorized/non-motorized) or associated seasons of use.  At this time relatively few USFS trails are shown on US Topo (other than selected NSTs and in Colorado, as described above). -- Selected trails in Alaska from unpublished data provided by Alaska Department of Natural Resources and various federal agencies -- The International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA) shares their bicycle trails data with USGS as part of an ongoing partnership. IMBA-collected trails are generally not shown inside delineated Federal lands (e.g., National Forests) on US Topo maps.</othercit>

            <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>Railroads are derived from an unpublished data set provided to USGS by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Geographic Information Science and Technology Group (GIST). Following is an excerpt from the GIST description of the data set; the original data contain attributes not used by US Topo: The rail lines layer represents the freight lines of the nation's railroad system. The data set covers all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as territories and possessions of the United States. No rail lines exist in American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the US. Phase 1 of this product is a completed deliverable. This phase involved adding and validating network attribute data including railroad ownership, trackage and haulage rights, operational status, operating subdivisions, signaling systems, track class and traffic density. Phase 2 adjusted the topological alignment of the track using the best available remote sensing imagery. Information originally based on the Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) 1:100K rail network. The data have been updated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Geographic Information Science and Technology Group (GIST).</othercit>

            <othercit>Runway outlines are for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-recognized public and private airports in the United States. The FAA runway coordinates, FAA_RunwayID, and Airport Location Codes were used by the USGS to digitize runway outlines on recent NAIP orthoimagery. The digitized data were inspected for accuracy and completeness then loaded into the USGS national transportation database.</othercit>

            <othercit>The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. The high-resolution NHD was originally created using 1:24,000-scale data. State and Local Stewards are improving the data by incorporating local updates based on more current and more accurate source data. Water features in the real world are relatively dynamic and the differences at the time of data collection mean that water features may not register exactly to other layers. The hydrographic feature names contained in and displayed by the NHD are extracted and validated from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). Spatial objects may be filtered or generalized to achieve a 1:24,000-scale representation. -- For Alaska only, NHD data were originally captured from the 1:63,360 USGS topographic map series. These data are being continually upgraded by the USGS and partner organizations in Alaska. Currency, accuracy, and resolution therefore vary.</othercit>

            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the United States and its Territories. While the Fish and Wildlife Service produces a variety of wetland categories, only two (Emergent and Forest/Shrub wetlands as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979)) are included on US Topo Maps.The emergent wetlands depicted do not include lakes, rivers, open water ponds, deepwater marine and estuarine features or non-vegetated, farmed, intermittent and temporarily flooded wetlands. The goal is to provide a visual depiction of the approximate location and extent of Emergent and Forest/Shrub wetlands. Digital wetlands data are intended for use with base maps and digital aerial photography at a scale of 1:12,000 or smaller. Due to the scale, the primary intended use is for data display on the US Topo Maps. This data display is not intended for analysis. The map products were neither designed or intended to represent legal or regulatory products. Questions or comments regarding the interpretation or classification of wetlands can be addressed by visiting http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/FAQs.html These data were developed in conjunction with the publication Cowardin, L.M., V. Carter, F.C. Golet, and E.T. LaRoe. 1979. Classification of Wetlands and Deepwater Habitats of the United States. U.S. Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, DC. FWS/OBS-79/31. For more information on the wetland classification codes visit http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/Data/Wetland-Codes.html. Note that coastline delineations were drawn to follow the extent of wetland features as described by this project and may not match the coastline shown in other base maps.</othercit>

            <othercit>The Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI 2.0) is a global inventory of glacier outlines. It is supplemental to the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space initiative (GLIMS). Production of the RGI was motivated by the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5). Updates beyond the IPCC 2012 deadlines will take the form of additions to the GLIMS Glacier Database. As resources allow, all these data will be incorporated into the GLIMS Glacier Database.  The RGI data are used without alteration by the U.S. Geological Survey for US Topo maps and are not yet integrated with other hydrography features from USGS datasets. Glacier names are from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).  RGI polygon boundaries are not shown in the US Topo representation.</othercit>

            <othercit>The boundary is a digital representation of the International boundary between the United States and Canada as per the Treaty of 1908. It has been generated from a combination of recent surveys and datum conversions. It is intended for general mapping purposes only. The boundary dataset is composed of 29 segments that correspond to the original 256 boundary maps. Attributes of each segment define the scale in which the line in that area may be accurately depicted. It is produced for mapping purposes only and not intended to illustrate the boundary beyond the limits of the scale for any given segment.</othercit>

            <othercit>The international boundary between Mexico and the United States, defined as a joint venture between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía of Mexico (INEGI), resulted in an unofficial United States-Mexico boundary dataset that was further enhanced by the U.S. Geological Survey's Border Environmental Health Initiative (BEHI). With the data frame scale set to 1:5,000 in ArcMap, the center of the Rio Grande/Río Bravo was digitized using the NAIP 2004 Imagery. In areas with dense stands of salt cedar (bounding box = UL -104.714 30.038, UR -104.664 30.037, LR -104.666 29.933, LL -104.717 29.934; NAD83), the center of the channel was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to easily determine. To determine the location of the boundary, the GIS analyst compared the location of the line in the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class with the NAIP 2004 Imagery and adjusted the boundary to the image, thus, the delineation of the international boundary is less certain in these areas. The remaining part of the border was extracted from the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class and appended to the line feature class created along the Rio Grande/Río Bravo. The U.S. Geological Survey reviewed the original USDA data against 2007 NAIP imagery and further edited 9 line segments in the Rio Grande areas to conform to National Map Accuracy Standards.</othercit>

These sites encompass land which is federally owned or otherwise managed. This dataset was compiled by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) Program. This dataset represents the baseline for georeferenced boundaries of sites selected from the 2010 Base Structure Report. The boundary locations are intended for planning purposes only and do not represent the legal or surveyed land parcel boundaries. This list does not necessarily represent a comprehensive collection of all DoD facilities, and only those in the fifty United States and US Territories were considered for inclusion. Maps produced at a scale of 1:50,000 or larger which otherwise comply with National Map Accuracy Standards will remain compliant if this data is incorporated. Although these data have been provided by the DoD components, no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding the utility of the data on any other system, in derived products or data alterations, nor shall the act of distribution constitute such warranty.</othercit>

The USGS converted areas of generally 3 acres or less to point features to facilitate cartographic display on the US Topo digital map product. See Source URL for link to complete dataset. This data set is complete but subject to continual updates to reflect boundary amendments, legislation, and acquisitions, and improved processing techniques. The data is being regularly updated with verified boundaries from NPS Land Resources Division. The data is intended for use as a tool for display and general GIS analysis purposes only. It is in no way intended for engineering or legal purposes. The data accuracy is checked against best available sources which may be dated. NPS assumes no liability for use of this data. Boundaries from the Land Resources Division have separate polygons for each type of unit. For example Denali National Park and Denali National Preserve are separate individual polygons.</othercit>

            <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>This data set depicts simplified boundaries of lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service including National Wildlife Refuges, National Fish Hatcheries, FWS administrative sites, and other conservation areas. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge Boundaries data set depicts the legislative boundary of the 16 National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska at a source scale of 1:63,360. The dataset was created by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Division of Realty and Natural Resources. The USGS substituted the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge boundaries for the USFWS Simplified Wildlife Refuge Boundaries in Alaska for cartographic purposes. The USFWS Simplified Wildlife Refuge Boundaries are simplified from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Real Estate Interest data layer containing polygons representing tracts of land (parcels) in which the Service has a property or management interest. These interests include full land ownership, secondary interests in property primarily managed and reported by other federal agencies, leased property, property managed by agreement with other parties, and, within National Wildlife Refuges, property governed by conservation easements. A conservation easement is a permanent, legally enforceable land preservation agreement between a landowner and a government agency that restricts real estate, commercial and industrial development of the land, which remains private property. Inholdings of private property within Refuge areas not covered by conservation easements are excluded from these boundaries. The Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Waterfowl production area easements acquired through the small wetlands program have been omitted. Interior boundaries between parcels were dissolved to produce a single set of simplified external boundaries for each feature. These are resource grade mapping representations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service boundaries. For legal descriptions of the land represented here contact the USFWS Realty Office. This map layer was compiled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuges dataset was derived from the following digital sources and legal documents: 1) Federal Register, Vol. 48, No. 38 Thursday, February 24, 1983 Notices Pages 7890-8029. 2) USGS 1:250,000 scale Alaska Boundary Series maps entitled: Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act December 2, 1980 P.L. 96-487 3) Various legal documents such as survey plats, legal metes and bounds descriptions, Deeds, and Titles. 4) USGS 1:63,360 scale revised hydrography Digital Line Graphs depicting ground conditions from 1955 to 1986. Although these Fish and Wildlife boundaries represent lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, not all areas are open to the public. Some fragile habitats need to be protected from human traffic, some management areas are closed, and the terms of some conservation easements preclude public access. The public is urged to contact specific Refuges or other conservation areas before visiting.</othercit>

            <othercit>The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) information shown on these maps is for general reference purposes only and should not be used to determine legal boundaries or land ownership. US Topo maps are not legal documents. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the authoritative source for PLSS information at the federal level. The US Topo representation is derived from BLM GIS data files. Although this metadata record is included with all maps, PLSS is shown on US Topo maps for only states that have PLSS.  Metadata for BLM PLSS data can be located through http://nationalcad.org/PLSSWorkgroup/PLSSWorkgroup.html.  Note: Alaska PLSS consists of protracted (computed, not surveyed) data only. Section boundaries were generated from geodetic latitude and longitude coordinate pairs as recorded on BLM's official protraction diagrams of the state of Alaska. Metadata for Alaska PLSS is at http://sdms.ak.blm.gov/sdms/data_protracted_grid_gis.html.</othercit>

            <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>This contour featureclass was generated from the 1/3 arc-second version of the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The intended viewing scale for these features is 1:24,000. The contours are derived from a filtered elevation raster to achieve smoother arcs. The NED data were modified by the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) flow lines and water bodies to facilitate improved integration between the hypsography and hydrography on USGS map products. These contours were generated primarily for use as a layer in GeoPDFs created in the US Topo digital mapping program. The raster data source of contours is the National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1/3 arc-second layer. The 1/3 arc-second NED contains resampled data from the 1/9 arc-second layer of NED. Secondary datasets include the high resolution flow lines, water bodies, and areas from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The NHD layers are used in hydro-enforcement of the DEM prior to contour generation. The goals of the hydro-enforcement are to prevent contour lines from extending over the surface of water bodies and to align the contour reentrants with the NHD single-line streams. The NED raster cells are converted to points. Those points, along with the NHD flow lines are input into an interpolation tool to create a new surface. The NHD water bodies and areas are preprocessed to attach the minimum and maximum elevation to each polygon. From these precalculated values, an appropriate value is calculated by which to raise the elevation cells under the NHD polygons. The NHD polygons are then converted into rasters, which in turn will be used to generate a mosaic that includes the new raster surface. The mosaic is filtered to provide smoother contour lines. Contours are generated and depression and index contours are identified. There is no guarantee or warranty concerning the accuracy of the data. Users should be aware that temporal changes may have occurred since these data were collected and generated and that some parts of these data may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Hydro-enforcement and generalization can also significantly alter the spatial characteristics of the contours. Users should not use these data for critical applications without a full awareness of its limitations.</othercit>

            <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The Woodland Tint is a derivative land cover product created using several national map layers: three National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011 raster layers (Tree Canopy, Imperviousness, and Land Cover); and two vector layers (National Hydrography Dataset and Transportation). The process begins with masking the NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Data cartographic with NLCD 2011 Imperviousness (values from 1-100), and NLCD 2011 Land Cover (value 11 = Open Water). The resulting raster data with canopy values of 20 and greater are converted to woodland vector polygons and smoothed via the Paek Algorithm. The woodland polygons are masked with buffered Transportation (Roads, Airport Runways, and Railroads) and Hydrography (NHD Areas excluding Inundation Area and NHD Waterbodies excluding Swamp/Marsh). The resulting polygons are checked for scale appropriate size (minimum size of one acre), and the small woodland polygons as well as small clearings within the woodland polygons are deleted. For Alaska, the Woodland Tint is a derivative land cover product created using five national map layers: one raster layer, National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2011 (Land Cover); and four vector layers (National Hydrography Dataset, Transportation Roads, Transportation Airports and Transportation Railroads). The process begins with combining three NLCD 2011 Land Cover V1 Classes (41 - Deciduous Forest, 42 - Evergreen Forest, and 43 - Mixed Forest). The resulting raster data was converted to woodland vector polygons, and smoothed via the Paek Algorithm. The woodland polygons are masked with buffered Transportation (Roads, Airport Runways, and Railroads) and Hydrography (NHD Areas excluding Inundation Areas and NHD Waterbodies excluding Swamp/Marsh). The resulting polygons are checked for scale appropriate size (minimum size of one acre), and the small woodland polygons as well as small clearings within the woodland polygons are deleted.</othercit>

            <geoform>raster digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The Shaded relief is a derivative elevation product created from the National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1/3 arc second.  First there are five separate shaded relief datasets created from the original data.  Each shaded relief has different azimuths and altitude values as follows: 00 450, 1350 600, 2700 450, 3150 450, 450 450.  These five datasets are then combined into one feature class using map algebra to compute the raster layers using the following equation shadedrelief1 + shadedrelief2 + shadedrelief3 + (shadedrelief4 x 2) + shaded relief5 \ 6.  This equation gives double importance to the 3150 azimuth and 450 elevation.</othercit>

    <overview>
      <eaover>This is a general-purpose design and layout map based on the traditional USGS quadrangle cells. The domain for the conterminous 48 states, plus Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is a standard 7.5-minute cell. Due to the convergence of longitudes, in Alaska cell size will vary as noted: south of 59 degrees N latitude = 7.5' x 10' (N-S by E-W), 59 to 62 degrees N latitude = 7.5' x 11.25', 62 to 68 degrees N latitude = 7.5' x 15', and north of 68 degrees N latitude = 7.5' x 18'.  In the conterminous 48 states plus Hawaii, the scale is 1:24,000, while in Alaska the scale is 1:25,000 and in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands the scale is 1:20,000.</eaover>
